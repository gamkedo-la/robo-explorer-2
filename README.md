# Some helpful notes

> Hi everyone! Welcome to the Robo-Explorer 2 project. I have decided to use Phaser as our game framework for the sequel of Robo-explorer which is my first vanilla JavaScript game that I was able to pitch as a team lead in HomeTeam. 



# Project Goals

> I am hoping to further improve my JavaScript skills and familiarity with a the new framework Phaser. 


# Things you will need for Phaser

1. You will need to install a webserver to run and test the game. I am currently using XAMPP. 
2. You will also see a lot of tutorials that has the npm approach. Still working on deciding on how that will be done. 



# Resources and Tutorials
